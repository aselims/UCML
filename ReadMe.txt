Executive Summary:
Ubiquitous Control Modeling Language (UCML) is an XML-based language aiming at utilizing the local resources of smart handheld devices and making mobile phone users aware and involved in contributing to the technology that exists in their hands. UCML focuses on developing and executing ubiquitous control applications within smart mobile devices by typing specific predefined XML elements in UCML modules. The module function is to acquire data from mobile phone built-in sensors, apply conditions on these data, and trigger a response when these conditions are satisfied. The user can identify which sensor, condition and response to be used. UCML application has been designed to be friendly, easy-to-use, natural-understanding language that is suitable for sensor-interested mobile phone users. Google’s Android is the chosen platform to be the underlying operating system for UCML.
